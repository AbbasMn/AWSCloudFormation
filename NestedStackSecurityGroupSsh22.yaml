# Exported Stack Output Values (Cross Stacks) vs. Nested Stacks:
#   Cross Stacks (Fn::ImportValue) is helpful when stacks have different lifecycles

#   If you have a central resource that is shared between many different other stacks, use <<Cross Stacks>>
#   If you need other stacks to be updated right away if a central resource is updated, use <<Cross Stackss>>

#   If the resources can be dedicated to one stack only and must be re-usable pieces of code, use <<Nested Stacks>>
#   Note: that you will need to update each Root stack manually in case of Nested stack updated

# Nested stacks (best practice) are stacks as part of other stacks, 
# and allow you to isolated repeated patterns/common components in separate stacks and call them from other stacks
# ex. eused Load Balancer configuration, reused Security Group

# The nested stack is only important to the higher-level stack (it's not shared)

# always update parent (root stack) for updating a nested stack

# Nested Stacks Update: 
#   1- Ensure the updated nested stacks are uploaded onto S3 first
#   2- Then re-upload your root stack

# Nested Stacks Delete:
#  1-never delete or apply changes to the nested stack
#  2-always do changes from the top-level stack(parent or root stack)
