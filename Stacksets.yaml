# we're going to deploy StackSets across multiple regions to enable AWS Config within each region. 
# And the idea is that you are going to be able to track the resource configuration over time of all
# your resources within all regions within the same account

# Step 1: create IAM roles (StackSetAdministrationRole.yaml) So we're giving the administrator the right to basically assume roles 
#         in the target account from which you will be able to deploy StackSets.
# Create a cloudFormation stack => Upload this StackSetAdministrationRole.yaml

# Step 2: add the trust relationships (Execution Role): StackSetExecutionRole.yaml
# Note: So this CloudFormation templates must be applied in all the target accounts that you want to use the StackSet feature in.
# This is an initial setup that you cannot avoid unless you are using AWS organizations.

# Step 3: Creat a new stack and apply/update StackSetExecutionRole.yaml template 
# It connects and StackSetExecutionRole Now aks for the ParamAdministratorAccountId
# Copy-Past Account ID from AWS Console => Top Right Menu => My account

# Step 4:  StackSets => Create StackSets => we will use this StackSetsEnableAwsConfigAcrossAccounts.yaml template and deploy it now as part of our StackSet.
#   - Permissions => IAM admin role ARN => look for: AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole
#   - Permissions => IAM execution role name => look for: AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole
#   - Account numbers =>  Copy-Past Account ID from AWS Console => Top Right Menu => My account
#   - Specify regions => add 2 regions or more
#   - Deployment options => Maximum concurrent accounts:1 & Region Concurrency:Parallel

# Step 5: after StackSets created => go to each region and see the created StackSets overthere
