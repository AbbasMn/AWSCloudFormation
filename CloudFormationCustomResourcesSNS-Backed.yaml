# Custom Resources with SNS (SNS-Backed Custom Resources):
# -Weâ€™ll create a custom resource that publishes requests to SNS topic
# -This SNS topic will publish to an HTTP endpoint, which will  handle all custom resource requests


# it's a bit more complicated and would recommend to have Lambda first, if you can, So we have the user that will create update and delete 
# the CloudFormation template.
# The stack we'll have a Custom Resource backed by an SNSTopic, and there will be a subscriber to the SNSTopic, which is going to be an 
# HTTP endpoint.
# So SNS is going to publish information into this HTTP subscriber. And then the subscriber will do a posting to a web server and do some 
# actions before sending back the data to cloud formation.

# Okay, so let's create a web server and this web server will be listening to requests coming from SNS.

# This is going to install node js. So we just run the setup of node js like this. And then we do yum install node js. Then we install our 
# application.
# So we create a web server directory. We initialize an NPM. So a node js project, then install a few libraries such as express buddy-parser, 
# chalk and most importantly cfn-response which is a similar library to where we had a when we were doing with the Python example with lamba X. 
# So this is going to help us give a response back into CloudFormation, and then we're going to own the directory with the user to fix 
# permissions in terms of files.

# We're going to create a new security group with a custom TCP rule on port 8080. This is where it's going to be listening for incoming HTTP requests.

# that the instance is going to be launched. We will SSH into it and then we will install a file name serve.js is a node js file so don't 
# worry too much about it.

# And then finally, we're going to run this server and to do so, we'll just type in node server.js And now we have an HTTP server that 
# is listening on port 8080.

# So we're creating an SNSTopic right now. And what should happen is that the SNSTopic should create a subscription. And that subscription 
# should arrive into our web server if everything is working properly.

# The Custom Resource should send a message into SNS and then the SNS forwards the message into our EC2 instance web server.
